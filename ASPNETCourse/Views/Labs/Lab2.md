# Building and Publishing ASP.NET Applications with Microsoft Azure Websites #

---
<a name="Overview"></a>
## Overview ##

Web site publication and deployment has never been easier in Microsoft Azure. Using familiar tools such as Web Deploy or Git, and virtually no changes to the development workflow, Microsoft Azure Websites is the next step in the Microsoft Azure platform for web developers. 

In this hands-on lab, you will explore the basic elements of the **Microsoft Azure Websites** service by creating a simple **ASP.NET MVC 5** application, which uses scaffolding to automatically generate the baseline of your application's CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete). Then, you will deploy it using Web Deploy from Microsoft Visual Studio and finally, you will enable source control and use Git to publish directly from your local computer.

Starting from a simple model class and without writing a single line of code, you will create a controller that will contain all the CRUD operations, as well as all the necessary views. After publishing and running the solution, you will have the model generated in your SQL Database, together with the MVC logic and views for data manipulation.

<a name="Exercise1"></a>
### Exercise 1: Creating a Microsoft Azure Web Site with Visual Studio ###

In this exercise, you will take advantage of the Microsoft Azure tools for Visual Studio to create a Microsoft Azure Web Site. Through **Server Explorer**, you will connect to Microsoft Azure by signing in with your Microsoft Account and then create a Microsoft Azure Web Site and its associated SQL database.

#### Task 1 – Adding a New Microsoft Azure Web Site from Server Explorer ####

1. Open **Microsoft Visual Studio Express 2013 For Web** and then open **Server Explorer** by selecting **View | Server Explorer**.

1. In **Server Explorer**, right-click the **Microsoft Azure** node and select **Connect to Microsoft Azure...**. Sign in using the Microsoft account associated with your Microsoft Azure account.

	![Connect to Microsoft Azure](../Images/connect-to-windows-azure.png?raw=true)

	_Connect to Microsoft Azure_

1. After sign in, the **Microsoft Azure** node is populated with the resources in your Microsoft Azure subscription.

1. Expand the **Microsoft Azure** node, right-click the **Websites** node and select **Add New Site...**.

	![Add new site](../Images/add-new-website.png?raw=true)

	_Add new site_

1. In the **Create site on Microsoft Azure** dialog box, provide the following information:
	- In the **Site name** box, enter an available name for the Web site.
	- In the **Location** drop-down list, select the region for the Web site. This setting specifies which data center your Web site will run in.
	- In the **Database server** drop-down list, select **Create new server**. Alternatively, you can select an existing SQL Server.
	- In the **Database username** and **Database password** boxes, enter the administrator username and password for the SQL Server. If you select a SQL Server you have already created, you will be prompted for the password.

1. Click **Create** to create the Web site.

	![Create site on Microsoft Azure](../Images/create-site-on-windows-azure.png?raw=true)

	_Create site on Microsoft Azure_

1. Wait for the new Web site to be created.

	> **Note:** By default, Microsoft Azure provides domains at _azurewebsites.net_ but also gives you the possibility to set custom domains using the Microsoft Azure Management Portal (right-click your Web site from Server Explorer and select **Open Management Portal**). However, you can only manage custom domains if you are using certain Web site modes.
	
	> Microsoft Azure offers 3 modes for users to run their Websites - Free, Shared, and Standard. In Free and Shared mode, all Websites run in a multi-tenant environment and have quotas for CPU, Memory, and Network usage. You can mix and match which sites are Free (strict quotas) vs. Shared (more flexible quotas). The maximum number of free sites may vary with your plan. In Standard mode, you choose which sites run on dedicated virtual machines that correspond to the standard Azure compute resources. You can find the Websites Mode configuration in the **Scale** menu of your Web site.

	> ![Web Site Modes](../Images/web-site-modes.png?raw=true "Web Site Modes")

	> If you are using **Shared** or **Standard** mode, you will be able to manage custom domains for your Web site by going to your Web site’s **Configure** menu and clicking **Manage Domains** under _domain names_.

	> ![Manage Domains](../Images/manage-domains.png?raw=true "Manage Domains")

	> ![Manage Custom Domains](../Images/manage-custom-domains.png?raw=true "Manage Custom Domains")

1. Once the Web site is created, it will be displayed in Server Explorer under the **Websites** node. Right-click the new Web site and select **Open in Browser** to check that the Web site is running.

### Exercise 2: Creating an MVC 5 Application with Entity Framework ###

In this exercise, you will create a simple ASP.NET MVC 5 web application, using ASP.NET scaffolding with Entity Framework to create the CRUD methods.

<a name="GettingStartedTask1"></a>
#### Task 1 – Creating an ASP.NET MVC 5 Application in Visual Studio ####

1. In **Microsoft Visual Studio Express 2013 For Web**, click the **New Project...** link in the start page or use **File** | **New Project...**.

	![Creating a new project](../Images/creating-a-new-project.png?raw=true)

	_Creating a new project_

1. Create a new **ASP.NET Web Application** using **.NET Framework 4.5**, **C#** and name it **MVCSample.Web**. Click **OK** to continue.

	![Creating a new ASP.NET Web Application](../Images/creating-a-new-aspnet-web-application.png?raw=true)

	_Creating a new ASP.NET Web Application_

	![Choosing MVC project template](../Images/choosing-mvc-project-template.png?raw=true)

	_Choosing MVC project template_
	
1. In the **Solution Explorer**, right-click **Models** and select **Add | Class...** to create a customer class (POCO). Name it _Customer.cs_ and click **Add**.

1. Open the **Customer** class and insert the following properties.

	<!-- mark:10-24 -->
	````C#
	using System;
	using System.Collections.Generic;
	using System.Linq;
	using System.Web;

	namespace MVCSample.Web.Models
	{
		public class Customer
		{
			public int CustomerId { get; set; }

			public string Name { get; set; }

			public string Phone { get; set; }

			public string Address { get; set; }

			public string Company { get; set; }

			public string Title { get; set; }

			public string Email { get; set; }

			public string Image { get; set; }
		}
	}
	````

1. Build **MVCSample.Web** by using the **Ctrl + Shift + B** keyboard shortcut which will save the changes and build the project.

1. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the **Controllers** folder and select **Add | Controller...**. 

1. In the **Add Scaffold** dialog box, select the **MVC 5 Controller with views, using Entity Framework** scaffolding type and click **Add**.

	![Choosing scaffolding option](../Images/scaffolding-options.png?raw=true)

	_Choosing scaffolding option_

1. Complete the scaffolding options in the **Add Controller** dialog box with the following values.
	- In the **Controller name** box, type _CustomerController_.
	- Select the **Use async controller actions** checkbox.
	- In the **Model class** drop-down list, select the **Customer** class.
	- In the **Data Context class** field, click **\<New data context...\>**. In the dialog box displayed, replace the data context class type with **MVCSample.Web.Models.CustomerContext** and click **OK**.
	- In the **Views** section, make sure that all checkboxes are selected.

	![Adding the Customer controller with scaffolding](../Images/add-customer-controller.png?raw=true)

	_Adding the Customer controller with scaffolding_
	
1. Click **Add** to create the new controller for **Customer** with scaffolding. Visual Studio will then generate the controller actions, Customer data context and the views. 
		
	![After creating the Customer controller with scaffolding](../Images/customer-scaffolding.png?raw=true)

	_After creating the Customer controller with scaffolding_

1. Open the **CustomerController.cs** file in the **Controllers** folder. Notice that the CRUD action methods have been generated automatically. 

	> **Note:** By selecting the **Use async controller actions** checkbox from the scaffolding options in the previous steps, Visual Studio generates asynchronous action methods for all actions that involve access to the Customer data context. It is recommended to use asynchronous action methods for long-running, non-CPU bound requests to avoid blocking the Web server from performing work while the request is being processed.

	````C#
	...

	// POST: /Customer/Create
	// To protect from overposting attacks, please enable the specific properties you want to bind to, for 
	// more details see http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=317598.
	[HttpPost]
	[ValidateAntiForgeryToken]
	public async Task<ActionResult> Create([Bind(Include="CustomerId,Name,Phone,Address,Company,Title,Email,Image")] Customer customer)
	{
		if (ModelState.IsValid)
		{
			 db.Customers.Add(customer);
			 await db.SaveChangesAsync();
			 return RedirectToAction("Index");
		}

		return View(customer);
	}

	// GET: /Customer/Edit/5
	public async Task<ActionResult> Edit(int? id)
	{
		if (id == null)
		{
			 return new HttpStatusCodeResult(HttpStatusCode.BadRequest);
		}
		Customer customer = await db.Customers.FindAsync(id);
		if (customer == null)
		{
			 return HttpNotFound();
		}
		return View(customer);
	}

	...
	````
