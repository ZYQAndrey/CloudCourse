# Getting Started with the Azure Preview Portal #

---

<a name="Overview" />
## Overview ##

The new Azure Preview portal is an all-in-one, work-anywhere experience. Now you can manage websites, databases, and Visual Studio Online team projects in a reimagined UX personalized to your work style. It was built from the ground up to put your _applications_ at the center of the experience. 

This unified hub radically simplifies building, deploying, and managing your cloud resources. Imagine a single easy-to-use console built just for you —your team, your projects. It brings together all of the cloud resources, team members, and lifecycle stages of your application and provides you with a centralized place to plan, develop, test, provision, deploy, scale, and monitor those applications. This approach can help teams embrace a DevOps culture by bringing both development and operations capabilities and perspectives together in a meaningful way.

The new portal allows each user to transform the portal home page (called the _Startboard_) into their own customized dashboard. Stay on top of the things that matter most by pinning them to your **Startboard**. Resize parts to show more or less data. Drill in for all the details. And see insights (and opportunities) across apps and resources. New components include the following:

* **Simplified Resource Management**. Rather than managing standalone resources such as Microsoft Azure Websites, Visual Studio Projects or databases, customers can now create, manage and analyze their entire application as a single resource group in a unified, customized experience, greatly reducing complexity while enabling scale. Today, the new Azure Manager is also being released through the latest Azure SDK for customers to automate their deployment and management from any client or device. 

* **Integrated billing**. A new integrated billing experience enables developers and IT pros to take control of their costs and optimize their resources for maximum business advantage.

* **Gallery**. A rich gallery of application and services from Microsoft and the open source community, this integrated marketplace of free and paid services enables customers to leverage the ecosystem to be more agile and productive.

* **Visual Studio Online**. Microsoft announced key enhancements through the Microsoft Azure Preview Portal. This includes Team Projects supporting greater agility for application lifecycle management and the lightweight editor code-named “Monaco” for modifying and committing Web project code changes without leaving Azure. Also included is Application Insights, an analytics solution that collects telemetry data such as availability, performance and usage information to track an application’s health. Visual Studio integration enables developers to surface this data from new applications with a single click.

If you choose a different settings collection for your development environment, there may be differences in the steps that you should take into account.

<a name="Exercise1" />
### Exercise 1: Creating a Web Site + SQL ###

Historically, managing a resource (a user-managed entity such as a database server, database or web site,) in Microsoft Azure required you to perform operations against one resource at a time. When developing for the cloud today, we are often managing _individual resources_ (databases, storage, cloud services, virtual machines, and so on). It’s left up to us as cloud developers and IT professionals to piece these resources together in a meaningful way and manage them over time. The Microsoft Azure Preview portal was designed to bring together all of the individual resources of an application into a consolidated view. Resource group is a new concept in Azure that serves as the lifecycle boundary for all of its resources. 

In this exercise, you will learn how to create a new Web Site and a SQL Server using the Azure Preview portal.

<a name="Ex1Task1" />
#### Task 1 – Creating a Website + SQL ####

In this task, you will login to the Azure Preview portal and create a new Web Site and SQL Server.

1. Open a browser and browse to http://portal.azure.com and log in using your credentials.

1. The first thing you will see is the **Startboard**. This is your home page, where you can see dynamic data from your resources and all the details you care about. You can customize it as you see fit.

	> **Note:** You can right-click on the tiles of the Startboard to customize it. You can pin or unpin tiles and change their size.
	
	![Startboard](../Images/startboard.png?raw=true)
	
	_Your Home Page: The Startboard_

1. On the left side, you will see the **Hub Menu**. This is the navigation menu where you can access all of your resources and options. Click the **New** button at the bottom of the **Hub Menu**.

	![Creating a new resource](../Images/creating-a-new-resource.png?raw=true)
	
	_Creating a new resource_

1. A panel is displayed with different options. You can choose one of the options to create a new resource. In this case, you will select **Website + SQL**.

	![Selecting Website + SQL](../Images/selecting-website-sql.png?raw=true)
	
	_Selecting Website + SQL_
	
	A _blade_ is opened. Blades are your entry point to discover insights, perform actions, and build applications. This particular _blade_ collects input from you to create a new **Website + SQL**.

	> **Note:** For more information about _blades_, you can click the **Tour** tile on your **Startboard**. On the **Tour** blade, scroll down to the bottom and click **Learn more**. A new blade is opened with further information. You can continue the **Tour** to learn the basics of Blades, Commands, Lenses and more.
	
	> ![Tour](../Images/tour.png?raw=true)

1. When you create an application that consists of several resources working together (like in this example, a Website + SQL), it is always created in its own resource group so that you can manage the lifecycle of all related assets. Coose a name for the **Resource Group**, for example _MyResourceGroup_, and click the **Website** option.

	> **Note:** Resource group names can only contain letters, numbers, periods, underscores and dashes.

	![New Resource Group](../Images/new-resource-group.png?raw=true)
		
	_New Resource Group_

1. Another blade is opened which displays the options to create a new **Website**. Select a URL for your Website, for example _mynewazurewebsite_. Take into account that this name must be unique. Click the **Web Hosting Plan** option.

	![Changing the Web Hosting Plan](../Images/changing-the-web-hosting-plan.png?raw=true)
	
	_Changing the Web Hosting Plan_

1. In the _Choose your pricing tier_ blade, choose the hosting plan that fits your needs and click **Select**. Web hosting plans represent a set of features and capacity that you can share across your Websites. Web hosting plans support several pricing tiers (e.g. Free, Shared, Basic and Standard), each with its own capabilities. There are a couple of differences among these tiers. Plans in the Free and Shared tier provide sites with a shared infrastructure, meaning that your sites share resources with other customers' sites. Web hosting plans in the Basic and Standard tiers provider sites with a dedicated infrastructure, meaning that only the site or sites you choose to associate with this plan will be running on those resources. In this tier you can configure your web hosting plan to use one or more virtual machine instances.

	> **Note:** For all tiers (except 'Shared') you pay one price for the web hosting plan based on the tier and your chosen capacity with no additional charge for each site that uses the plan. Shared web hosting plans are different; due to the nature of the shared infrastructure, you are charged separately for each site in the plan. 
	
	![Selecting a Web Hosting Plan](../Images/selecting-a-web-hosting-plan.png?raw=true)

	![The Team Project is Created](../Images/the-team-project-is-created.png?raw=true)
	
	_The Team Project is created_

	> **Note:** The summary part is a Resource Map. The Resource Map is a visualization of a **Resource Group**, which is a model where the relationship between resources is stored, along with other important information. For this application, you can see the relationship between the team project, and the Visual Studio Online account.

	> **Note:** If you want to add users to the team project, in the **Team Project** blade, click the **Users** part for more information on how to add them. Basically, to add people you have to sync your user accounts or simply add them one by one. You can then assign users to you team project.
	
<a name="Ex2Task2" />
#### Task 2 - Enabling Continuous Integration ####

In this task, you will set up continuous deployment in your Team Project. Then you will check in code to see how an automatic deployment is triggered.

<a name="Exercise3" />
### Exercise 3: Creating Azure Environments using Azure Resource Manager ###

**Azure Resource Manager** introduces an entirely new way of thinking about your Azure resources. Instead of creating and managing individual resources, you begin by imagining a complex service, such as a blog, a photo gallery, a SharePoint portal, or a wiki. You use a template -- a resource model of the service -- to create a resource group with the resources that you need to support the service. Then, you can manage and deploy that resource group as a logical unit.

In this exercise, you learn how to use Azure PowerShell with Resource Manager for Microsoft Azure. You will go through the process of downloading, updating and creating a resource group for a Web site with a SQL database.

> **Note:** You can read the **Understanding Azure Resource Manager** Hands-on lab for deeper insights about Azure Resource Manager and the Template language specification.

<a name="Ex3Task1" />
#### Task 1 - Downloading Resource Group Template ####

In this task you will use Azure PowerShell for Azure Resources to list the available templates from the gallery and then download one JSON template to create a Web site and a SQL Database.

1. Open Azure PowerShell console.

1. Execute the following command to change from the _Azure_ module to the _Azure Resource Manager_ module.

	````PowerShell
	Switch-AzureMode AzureResourceManager
	````

	![Switch-AzureMode](../Images/switch-azuremode.png?raw=true "Switch-AzureMode")
	
	_Switch-AzureMode command_
	
	 >**Note**: The **AzureResourceManager** module, introduced in Azure PowerShell version 0.8.0, lets you manage your resources in an entirely new way. Instead of creating individual resources and trying to use them together, begin by imagining the service you want to create, such as a web portal, a blog, a photo gallery, a commerce site, or a wiki.

	>Select a resource group template for the service, from among dozens in the Azure template gallery, or create your own. Each template provides a model of a complex service, complete with the resources that you need to support the service. Then use the template to create a resource group and its resources, and deploy and manage the related resources as a unit.

	>Beginning in version 0.8,0, the Azure PowerShell installation includes the Azure and **AzureResourceManager** modules, and **AzureProfile**, a module of cmdlets common to both modules. The Azure and **AzureResourceManager** modules are not designed to work together in the same session.

	>When you use the Azure PowerShell cmdlets, the Azure module is imported into the session by default. To remove the Azure module from the session and import the **AzureResourceManager** and **AzureProfile** modules, use the **Switch-AzureMode** cmdlet.

1. Execute the following command to authenticate to Microsoft Azure and download the subscriptions associated with the account.

	````PowerShell
	Add-AzureAccount
	````

1. In the **Sign-in to Microsoft Azure** dialog box, enter your **Microsoft Account** and click **Continue**. You may be required to enter the password on the next step.

	![Sign in to Microsoft Azure dialog box](../Images/sign-in-to-windows-azure-dialog-box.png?raw=true "Sign in to Microsoft Azure dialog box")
	
	_Signing in to Microsoft Azure dialog box_

1. Once the authentication process is complete, one of your subscriptions is set as the default subscription.

	![Add-AzureAccount](../Images/add-azureaccount.png?raw=true "Add-AzureAccount")
	
	_Add-AzureAccount command_
	
	>**Note**: The **Set-AzureSubscription** cmdlet configures common settings including subscription ID, management certificate, and custom endpoints. The settings are stored in a subscription data file in the user’s profile or in a user specified file. Multiple subscription data sets are supported and identified by a subscription name. To select a subscription and make it current, use the **Select-AzureSubscription** cmdlet. 
	
1. Execute the following command to get the list of resources from the group gallery templates.

	````PowerShell	
	Get-AzureResourceGroupGalleryTemplate
	````

	>**Note**: A resource group template is a JSON string that defines a resource group for a complex entity, such as a web portal, a blog, a photo gallery, a commerce site, or a wiki. The template defines the resources that are typically needed for the entity, such as Websites, database servers, databases and storage accounts, and includes parameters for user-defined values, such as the names and properties of the resources. To create a resource group with a template, just identify the template and provide values for its parameters.

1. You can review the gallery template and its properties, including icons and screenshots. Use the **Get-AzureResourceGroupGalleryTemplate** command to review the **Microsoft.WebSiteSQLDatabase.{version}-preview** template and its properties. Replace {version} with the number listed on your screen (e.g.: 0.1.0).

	````PowerShell
	Get-AzureResourceGroupGalleryTemplate -Identity Microsoft.WebSiteSQLDatabase.0.1.0-preview1	
	````

	![Get-AzureRourceGroupGalleryTemplate](../Images/get-azurerourcegroupgallerytemplate.png?raw=true "Get-AzureRourceGroupGalleryTemplate")
	
	_Get-AzureRourceGroupGalleryTemplate command_
	
1.  To save a gallery template as a JSON file, use the **Save-AzureResourceGroupGalleryTemplate** cmdlet. Download the **Microsoft.WebSiteSQLDatabase.{version}-preview** template executing the following command replacing the _[FILE-PATH]_ placeholder. Remember to replace {version} with the number of your chosen template (e.g.: 0.1.0).

	````PowerShell
	Save-AzureResourceGroupGalleryTemplate -Identity Microsoft.WebSiteSQLDatabase.0.1.0-preview -Path [FILE-PATH]	
	````
	![Save-AzureResourceGroupGalleryTeamplate](../Images/save-azureresourcegroupgalleryteamplate.png?raw=true "Save-AzureResourceGroupGalleryTeamplate")
	
	_Save-AzureResourceGroupGalleryTeamplate command_

1. Open the File Explorer in the path were you saved the template and check that the file was correctly saved.

<a name="Ex3Task2" />
#### Task 2 - Creating a Resource Group from a Custom Template ####

In this task you will update the JSON file from the Simple website template and use the Azure cmdlets to create the new Resource Group in Microsoft Azure.

1. Open the JSON file you downloaded in the previous task in Visual Studio and locate the **parameters** section.

1. You will create your custom template by updating the websites with SQL Database template to use the site name parameter with the _\_db_ prefix as the database name. Remove the _databaseName_ parameter as it is no longer required.

1. Locate the **resources** section with type _databases_ and replace the **name** property with the following code.

	<!-- mark:4 -->
	````JSON
	...
	resources": [
        {
          "name": "[concat(parameters('siteName'), '_db')]",
          "type": "databases",
          "location": "[parameters('serverLocation')]",
          ...
        },
	...
	````
1. Locate the **resource** section with **type** _config_ and replace the **ConnectionString** property with the following code.

	<!-- mark:12 -->
	````JSON
	"resources": [
        {
          "apiVersion": "2014-04-01",
          "type": "config",
          "name": "web",
          "dependsOn": [
            "[concat('Microsoft.Web/Sites/', parameters('siteName'))]"
          ],
          "properties": {
            "connectionStrings": [
              {
                "ConnectionString": "[concat('Data Source=tcp:', reference(concat('Microsoft.Sql/servers/', parameters('serverName'))).fullyQualifiedDomainName, ',1433;Initial Catalog=', parameters('siteName'), '_db', ';User Id=', parameters('administratorLogin'), '@', parameters('serverName'), ';Password=', parameters('administratorLoginPassword'), ';')]",
                "Name": "DefaultConnection",
                "Type": 2
              }
            ]
          }
        }
	````

	>**Note**: Notice that we only replaced the **parameters('databaseName')** with **parameters('siteName'), '_db'** in the connection string.
	
1. Save the file and switch back to Azure PowerShell.

1. Switch to **AzureMode** using the following command.

	````PowerShell
	Switch-AzureMode AzureServiceManagement
	````
	
1. Replace the _[STORAGE NAME]_ placeholder and execute the following command to create a new storage account. Make sure that the storage name you selected is unique.

	````PowerShell
	New-AzureStorageAccount -StorageAccountName [STORAGE NAME] -Location "West US"
	````

1. Switch back to **AzureResourceManager** mode using the following command.

	````PowerShell

## Summary ##

The new Azure Preview portal offers an exciting look into the future of DevOps. This is a first-of-its-kind experience which brings together all of the individual resources, people, and lifecycle stages of your application into a unified portal. In this Hands-on lab, you learned how to create a new resource group by building a Website and a SQL Server. Then you set up continuous deployment using **Team Project** and edited the source code of the Website using Visual Studio Online. At the end of this lab, you learned how to create a custom Resource Group using **Azure Resource Manager** (via Azure PowerShell).
